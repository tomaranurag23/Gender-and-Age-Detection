# Gender and Age Detection 
 This Gender and Age Detection project uses OpenCV and Deep Learning to predict a personâ€™s gender (Male/Female) and estimate their age from images or real-time video. It utilizes pre-trained Caffe/TensorFlow models for accurate detection and classification. The system detects faces, processes them, and predicts age within predefined ranges (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, 8-12, etc.). It runs efficiently with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. Simply install dependencies, run the script, and get real-time predictions. Future improvements include enhanced accuracy, multi-face detection, and a GUI for better usability.
